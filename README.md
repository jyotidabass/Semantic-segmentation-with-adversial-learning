# SegAN - Semantic Segmentation with Adversarial Learning

A PyTorch implementation of image segmentation GAN from the paper [SegAN: Adversarial Network with Multi-scale L1 Loss for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.01805.pdf) by Yuan Xue, Tao Xu, Han Zhang, L. Rodney Long, Xiaolei Huang.

#### Data

The data used is from [LiTS - Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17094) dataset containing abdominal CT scans for liver and tumor segmentation.
